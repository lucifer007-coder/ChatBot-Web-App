# Chatbot WebApp Powered by OpenAI using Python

This is a simple chatbot web application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It allows users to have interactive conversations with the chatbot and receive responses generated by the model.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the application:

- openai
- streamlit
- streamlit_chat

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install openai streamlit streamlit_chat
```

## Setup

Before running the application, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. Replace `'your OpenAI api_key'` with your actual API key in the code:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your OpenAI api_key'
```

## Generating Responses

The `generate_response` function is responsible for generating responses from the OpenAI API. It takes a prompt as input and returns the generated response. The response is generated using the `text-davinci-003` language model with a maximum token limit of 1024 and a temperature of 0.5.

## Chat History

The application uses Streamlit to create a web interface. It displays a text input field where the user can enter their message. Each user message is stored in the `st.session_state['past']` list, and the corresponding chatbot response is stored in the `st.session_state['generated']` list.

The chat history is then displayed in reverse order, with the most recent messages at the top. The `message` function from `streamlit_chat` is used to display the messages.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the Python script containing the code. It will start a local server and display the web interface in your browser.

```bash
streamlit run your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the name of the Python file containing the code.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your browser after running the application.
2. Enter your message in the text input field labeled "You :" and press Enter.
3. The chatbot will generate a response based on your input and display it in the chat history.
4. You can continue the conversation by entering more messages.
5. The chat history will be displayed in reverse order, with the most recent messages at the top.

Feel free to explore and have interactive conversations with the chatbot!

Note: This is a basic implementation of a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It can be further improved and customized based on your specific requirements and use cases.
